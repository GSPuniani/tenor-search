<i>Make School BEW 1.3: GIF Search App</i>

This project is a simple GIF search using the [Tenor API](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation) with the [ExpressJS framework](https://expressjs.com). The HTML pages are rendered with [Handlebars templating](https://handlebarsjs.com). The home page displays a list of the top ten trending GIFs on Tenor, and a search query will result in ten GIFs related to the search terms.

This project was created by following the [Make School GIF Search App tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/gif-search-app-ynu).
